This is the API for the Feedback System, which allows users to provide feedback and comments.

## Getting Started

### API Documentation

The API documentation is available using Swagger UI. You can access it by following these steps:

1. Ensure that the Django server is running.
2. Go to the following URL in your browser:
     
     http://localhost:8000/api/schema/docs/
     

This will open up the Swagger UI interface where you can explore and interact with the API endpoints.
